#Classwork 1: Basic List Operations
#1. Create a list named fruits that contains the following items: "apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", and "elderberry".
#2. Print the entire list.
#. Access and print the first and last items in the list.
#4. Add a new fruit "fig" to the list.
#5. Remove "banana" from the list.
#6. Change the value of the second item to "blueberry".
#7. Print the length of the list.

# Classwork 2: List Functions and Methods
#1. Create a list named numbers that contains the following integers: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90.
#2. Use the append() function to add the number 100 to the end of the list.
#3. Use the insert() function to add the number 5 at the beginning of the list.
#4. Use the remove() function to remove the number 30 from the list.
#5. Use the sort() function to sort the list in ascending order.
#6. Use the reverse() function to reverse the order of the list.
#7. Use the index() function to find the index of the number 50.
#8. Use the count() function to count how many times 20 appears in the list.

# Classwork 3: Slicing and List Comprehensions
#Create a list named numbers that contains the integers from 1 to 10.
#Use list slicing to create a new list named first_half that contains the first five elements from numbers.
#Use list slicing to create another list named second_half that contains the last five elements from numbers.
#Use a list comprehension to create a new list named squares that contains the squares of each number in the numbers list.
#Print all three lists: first_half, second_half, and squares.
lis=["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]
